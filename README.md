# cplusplus_program

• Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  
  In this project I made 12 and 24 hour clocks. I also gave the option to the user to add a hour, a minute, a second, or exit the program.
  
• What did you do particularly well?

  I feel I made a good loop to update the times depending on user input and also implementing code to make sure the user only select the numbers from the menu.
  If the user entered anything beside the numbers from the menu then it would give a print statement say "INVALID INPUT".
  
• Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  To enhance my code I would like to make the clocks not static and work like an actual digital clock. I could not figure out how to do that but that would be one improvemnt I would have loved to make. I would also use seperate cpp files and header files to better organize the code.
  
• Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  
  I found the main loop the hardest as I couldn't figure out why it make an infinite loop if the user input was a character. I finally found a solution while searching google for hours to make there user input set to take only what I wanted it to.

• What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  The use of classes and loops will definitley be something that I use in other project and course work. I find classes to be useful in organizing the code and loops come in handy doing alot of things like printing a bunch of text without having to write a bunch of print statements.

• How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

 I made the program to where it is easily readable with inline comment and use classes and functions to make the code nice and organized. I believe someone with no coding experience could understand the program just from reading the inline comments.
